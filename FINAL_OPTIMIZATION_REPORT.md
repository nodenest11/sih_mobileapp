### Issue #1: ⚠️ Infinite Recursion Bug (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `lib/services/location_service.dart`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: 
```dart
void _addStatus(String status) {
  _addStatus(status);  // ❌ Infinite loop!
}
```

**Solution**:
```dart
void _addStatus(String status) {
  _statusController.add(status);  // ✅ Correct
}
```
