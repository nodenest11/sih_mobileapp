# 🚨 SOS Countdown Removal - Changes Summary

## Overview
Removed the SOS countdown feature and implemented immediate emergency alert sending with confirmation dialog.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`**

#### Removed:
- ❌ Import for `panic_countdown_screen.dart`

---

## New SOS Flow

### Before (With Countdown):
```
User Presses SOS → Countdown Screen (10s) → Can Cancel → Auto-Send → Result
```

### After (Immediate):
```
User Presses SOS → Confirmation Dialog → User Confirms → Loading → Immediate Send → Success/Error Feedback
```

---

## Code Changes

### Confirmation Dialog:
```dart
// Shows emergency confirmation with clear warning
- Title: "Emergency SOS" with red icon
- Message: Explains action and consequences
- Actions:
  - CANCEL button (dismisses)
  - SEND SOS button (red, triggers alert)
```

### Loading State:
```dart
// Shows progress during API call
- Center overlay with card
- Circular progress indicator
- Text: "Sending emergency alert..."
```

### Success Handling:
```dart
// After successful send:
1. Close loading dialog
2. Show green success snackbar
3. Start 1-hour cooldown timer
4. Refresh alerts list
```

### Error Handling:
```dart
// If send fails:
1. Close loading dialog
2. Show red error snackbar with reason
3. Log error for debugging
4. User can try again (no cooldown started)
```

## Benefits

### Advantages of Immediate Send:
