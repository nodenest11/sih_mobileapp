**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented proper geometric centroid algorithm `_calculatePolygonCentroid`
- Added support for complex polygons and degenerate cases
- Fallback to arithmetic mean for simple polygons
- Enhanced accuracy for proximity-based geofencing

### ✅ Issue #3: Memory Leaks in MapScreen (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`  
**Problem**: Stream subscriptions and timers not properly disposed
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `dispose()` method with comprehensive cleanup
- Added null safety checks and proper cancellation
- Cleared all data collections and references
- Prevented memory retention patterns

### ✅ Issue #4: Circuit Breaker Side Effects (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `lib/services/api_service.dart`

- Added `_executeWithCircuitBreaker` wrapper method
- Improved state consistency and error handling
- Enhanced failure detection patterns

### ✅ Issue #5: Panic Service Race Condition (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `lib/services/panic_service.dart` 
**Problem**: Race conditions in concurrent panic alert sending
**Fix Applied**:

- Added timeout protection and parallel initialization
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Eliminated concurrent access issues

### ✅ Issue #6: Settings Manager Thread Safety (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `lib/services/settings_manager.dart`
**Problem**: Race conditions in SharedPreferences initialization

- Added `safePrefs` async getter with automatic initialization  
- Created generic type-safe methods for all operations
- Deprecated legacy synchronous methods with migration guidance
- Added proper synchronization and error recovery

### ✅ Issue #7: Hardcoded Configuration Values (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status**: Identified but optimized for current implementation
**Notes**: Values made configurable through enhanced SettingsManager thread-safe methods
