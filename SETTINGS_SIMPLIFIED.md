## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Structure
```
lib/screens/
  ├── settings_screen.dart (NEW - simplified 480 lines)
  └── settings_screen_old_backup.dart (OLD - comprehensive 854 lines)
```

### Core Settings Still Work
All backend functionality remains intact:
- ✅ Location tracking with configurable intervals
- ✅ Proximity alerts with radius control
- ✅ Geofence monitoring
- ✅ Emergency contacts management
- ✅ Logout with cleanup

### Services Integration
Settings properly integrate with:
- `LocationService` - Start/stop tracking based on toggle
- `ProximityAlertService` - Enable/disable proximity monitoring
- `GeofencingService` - Enable/disable geofence monitoring
- `ApiService` - Handle authentication logout
- `SettingsManager` - Persist all settings to SharedPreferences
