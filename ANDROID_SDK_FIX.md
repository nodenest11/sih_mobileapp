**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ Issue

Firebase Messaging 16.0.2 requires Android SDK 23 minimum, but the app was configured for SDK 21.

### Error Message:
```
uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be smaller than version 23 declared in library [:firebase_messaging]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use minSdk 23:

```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    applicationId = "com.example.mobile"
    minSdk = 23  // Required by Firebase Messaging 16.0.2
    targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion
    versionCode = flutter.versionCode
    versionName = flutter.versionName
}
```
