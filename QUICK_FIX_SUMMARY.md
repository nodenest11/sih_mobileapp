## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIXED

### Infinite Recursion in LocationService
**File**: `lib/services/location_service.dart:31`

**The Problem**:
```dart
// ❌ BROKEN - Causes stack overflow crash
void _addStatus(String status) {
  if (!_statusController.isClosed) {
    _addStatus(status);  // Calls itself forever!
  }
}
```

**The Fix**:
```dart
// ✅ FIXED - Correctly adds status
void _addStatus(String status) {
  if (!_statusController.isClosed) {
    _statusController.add(status);
    AppLogger.service('Location Status: $status');
  }
}
```

**Impact**: This bug would cause **100% app crash** during location tracking. Now fixed!
